# how to use it
simply navigate your terminal on same directory where the file is 

in terminal type `streamlit run main.py`





# **EDA-Report_genrator**
 This Python script is a Streamlit application that provides an interactive interface for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset. It allows users to upload a CSV file, and the application then generates a comprehensive report, including:  
 
 Dataset Information: Displaying basic information about the dataset, such as the number of rows and columns, data types, and missing values. 
 
 Exploratory Data Analysis: Providing visualizations and statistical analysis of the data, including outlier detection, correlation analysis, and custom visualizations. 
 
 Summary: Generating a concise summary of the key insights and findings from the EDA process.



 # **Problem Solving and Use Cases**

 This Exploratory Data Analysis tool is useful for researchers, data analysts, and anyone working with data. It helps to quickly understand the structure, quality, and characteristics of a dataset, which is a crucial step in the data analysis process. By automating the EDA tasks and providing an interactive interface, the tool can save time and effort, allowing users to focus on more advanced data modeling and analysis.

## The use cases for this tool include:

** Data Exploration**: Quickly understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within a dataset, enabling more informed decision-making.


**Data Quality Assessment**: Identify and address data quality issues, such as missing values, outliers, and data type inconsistencies.


**Hypothesis Generation**: The insights gained from the EDA can help generate hypotheses and inform the next steps in the data analysis process.


**Reporting and Communication**: The generated summary can be used to share insights with stakeholders, team members, or in research publications.
